The sourcecode of IPv6Control. 
IPv6Control is a Windows application to make it easy to configure advance Microsoft Windows IPv6 settings. 
Currently IPv6Control can be used to disable or to enable IPv6 transition technologies on Microsoft Windows.
IPv6Control can be used to disable or to enable the following IPv6 transition technologies on Microsoft Windows.
- Teredo;
- ISATAP;
- 6to4;
- IP-HTTPS (IPv6 over https);

### Why might I want to disable (some of) these IPv6 technologies?
IPv6 transition technologies can create additional security risks by creating an increases the attack surface.
When you already have a native IPv6 address assigned then there is no need to run these transition technologies.
Also, the Teredo IPv6 transition technology is designed to bypass the NAT/router firewall.

### Issues
Feature requests, bug reports etc. are all handled through [Github Issues](https://github.com/D9ping/IPv6RegTweakGUI/issues).
